                <p>There is no other recording artist I would ever do this assignment on other than one of the world's greatest performers to ever exist. She is too classy for this world and forever that girl. Her expansive twenty-plus recording career includes a plenitude of iconic hits, acclaimed albums, and moments that will forever be symbolic of the icon that she is.</p>

                <p>Beyonce is a recording artist, singer, songwriter, fashion designer, philanthropist, icon, and performer who’s twelve American number-one singles (eight solos, four with Destiny’s Child) and eight American number-one albums (seven solos, one with destiny child.) have netted her countless acclaim and accolades in the music industry and the public. Her talent, longevity, and innovations in music do not compare to any other artist in the field. To this day, Beyonce remains peerless, as many others look to her (like me) for inspiration in their craft and lives.</p>
